Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. On this page, you'll find a collection of my open-source projects, ranging from small utilities to full-fledged applications.

One of my favorite projects is a Python library for data analysis, which I developed during my time as a graduate student. It includes a variety of tools for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data, as well as machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

In addition to my technical work, I'm also an advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I've contributed to several initiatives aimed at increasing representation and creating a more welcoming environment for underrepresented groups.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or feedback. I'm always looking for new collaborators and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
